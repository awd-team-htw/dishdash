# Meating Point

## Introduction
Meating Point is a simple tool designed to help groups of people find a suitable meeting point for activities like going out for dinner. It aims to find a restaurant that is close to each member of the group, making it convenient for everyone to reach.

## How it Works
Meating Point uses the geographical locations of the group members to calculate a central point that minimizes the total travel distance for everyone involved. It then suggests restaurants near this central point as potential meeting locations.

## Features
- **Efficient Location Calculation**: Uses algorithms to find the optimal meeting point based on the locations of group members.
- **Quick Suggestions**: Provides restaurant suggestions near the calculated meeting point to facilitate decision-making.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Allows users to specify preferences such as cuisine type, price range, etc., for restaurant suggestions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use by all members of the group.
